This test is performed on the base model

The test asserts that the id is allocated based on the number of
instance called without id
It is also assumed that only integer is fed into id so this is not tested

>>> from models.base import Base
>>> b1 = Base()
>>> print(b1.id)
1
>>> b2 = Base(12)
>>> print(b2.id)
12
>>> b3 = Base()
>>> print(b3.id)
2
